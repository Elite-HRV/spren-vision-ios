# Introduction

## Spren Vision

The Spren Finger Camera SDK (**Spren Vision**) is a useful tool for companies that don't already have their own device to collect inter-beat intervals. It's effortless to install and you can integrate it seamlessly into your mobile app in just a few steps! Check out our [Spren Vision iOS SDK](https://docs.spren.com/spren-vision/spren-vision-ios-sdk) or [Spren Vision Android SDK](https://docs.spren.com/spren-vision/spren-vision-android-sdk) pages for more information on installation, getting started, and code examples.

## Know Before You Code

Spren Vision is super easy to set up and integrate within your own mobile app. Once it's all integrated, your users will be able to take readings using their mobile device camera by placing their finger on the camera. Our public-facing code makes it easier for developers to drop our SDK in their code, interact with it in a variety ways, and customize certain parts of the reading pipeline.

There are a few requirements for this current version of SprenVision:

| **Item**            | **Requirement**                             |
